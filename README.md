# Toxicity Analyzer

Approach is an application that allows users to utilize Google's Perspective, a service that uses machine learning models to determine if statements are abusive. Perspective allows for rapid determinations in identifying toxicity, threats, insults, or identity attacks. The goal of Approach is to give users the opportunity to leverage this technology to determine possible attacks/threats in text.
